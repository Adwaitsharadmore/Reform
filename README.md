# Reform - AI-Powered Physical Therapy Platform

Reform is a web application that helps users perform physical therapy exercises at home with real-time form feedback using computer vision. The platform uses MediaPipe pose detection to analyze exercise form, count repetitions, and provide instant coaching cues.

## Features

###  Core Functionality

- **Real-time Form Analysis**: Uses MediaPipe Vision API to analyze exercise form in real-time through your webcam
- **Automatic Rep Counting**: Detects and counts exercise repetitions automatically
- **Form Scoring**: Provides quality scores for each repetition based on form analysis
- **Voice Coaching**: Audio feedback and coaching instructions during exercises
- **Exercise Plans**: Create and manage personalized PT exercise plans
- **Progress Tracking**: Session summaries with detailed analytics and improvement trends
- **Multiple Exercise Types**: Supports various exercises including:
  - Squats
  - Lunges
  - Shoulder Raise
  - Hip Hinge
  - Shoulder Press
  - Calf Raise

### User Experience

- **Live Session Interface**: Real-time camera feed with overlay feedback
- **Coaching Panel**: Side panel showing metrics, form checks, and progress
- **Demo Mode**: Try the application without setting up a full plan
- **Session Summaries**: Detailed post-session reports with insights
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
